# Project Title: Data Preprocessing and ML model development
## Overview
This project involves data preprocessing and machine learning model development for a given dataset. The tasks include data cleaning, feature selection, model training, and evaluation using various machine learning algorithms.
## Data Preprocessing
The notebook begins with data preprocessing tasks, which include:

**Handling Missing Values** :Using methods like KNNImputer and SimpleImputer.  
**Feature Scaling**: Applying normalization techniques where necessary.  
**Outlier Detection and Treatment**:Using statistical methods and winsorization.  
**Feature Encoding**:Transforming categorical variables using techniques like OneHotEncoder.  
## **Model Training and Evaluation:**  
The following machine learning models are trained and evaluated:

**Decision Tree Classifier  
Random Forest Regressor  
K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier  
Support Vector Regressor  
Gradient Boosting Regressor**  

## Evaluation metrics used include:

**Accuracy  
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
R-squared (R²) Score**  

## Results
The results of the model evaluations, including accuracy, MAE, MSE, and R² scores, are discussed and visualized in the notebook.
